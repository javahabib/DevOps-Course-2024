# üöÄ NGINX Docker Web App

Welcome to the **NGINX Docker Web App** repository! This is a simple web application that uses **Docker** to run an **Nginx** server which serves a static HTML page. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a basic cloud and DevOps setup.

## üìù Project Overview

This project uses the following:

- **Nginx**: Lightweight, high-performance web server.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure it runs consistently across different environments.

### üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `**index.html**`: A simple HTML file containing the webpage content.
- `**Dockerfile**`: A configuration file for building the Docker image and running the Nginx server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to run the application locally using Docker.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
  ```bash
   git clone <[repository-url](https://github.com/zaibunnisaq/DevOps-Course-2024/Docker_NGINX-Web-App)>
   cd <[repository-directory](https://github.com/zaibunnisaq/DevOps-Course-2024)>
```

###2Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Docker Image
In the project directory, build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t nginx-webapp .
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Docker Container
Once the image is built, run the container:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx-webapp
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ View the Web App
Now, open your browser and visit http://localhost:8080 to see the webpage being served

üåç Deploy to AWS EC2
Follow these steps to deploy your NGINX Docker web app on an AWS EC2 instance.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Launch an EC2 Instance
Go to the AWS EC2 Dashboard.
Click Launch Instance.
Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) such as Ubuntu.
Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free-tier).
Configure the instance and add storage if needed.
Create a new key pair or use an existing one for SSH access.

2Ô∏è‚É£ SSH into the EC2 Instance
After the instance is running, SSH into it using the following command:
```bash
ssh -i path/to/your-key.pem ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Docker on EC2
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
```
Enable and start Docker:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Build and Run the Docker Container on EC2
```bash
docker build -t nginx-webapp .
docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx-webapp
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Web App
Open your browser and visit the public IP of your EC2 instance

üîß How It Works
index.html: This file contains a basic webpage with the title "Cloud and DevOps Assignment" and additional details related to your assignment.

Dockerfile:
Uses the official nginx:alpine base image.
Copies index.html to Nginx's default HTML directory.
Exposes port 80 to make the page accessible from the outside.

üíª Technologies Used
Docker: For containerizing the web application.
Nginx: Web server to serve the static HTML content.
HTML: Simple web page displaying assignment details.
AWS EC2: Deployed the application in the cloud.
